If you place the word “{python}” immediately after the opening code blocks, you’ll get attractive syntax highlighting:\n\ndef f(x):\n    \"\"\"\n    A cool function that multiples an input x by 2. \n    \"\"\"\n    return 2*x\n\ny = f(3)\nprint(y)\n\n6\n\n\nNot only that, once you render the page with Quarto, the code output will show up below.
